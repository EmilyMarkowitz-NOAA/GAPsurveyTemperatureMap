## Use

These scripts create the daily tempertaure and anomaly plots as NOAA Fisheries' Alaska Fisheries Science Center conducts fisheries independant surveys in Alaska. 

These plots will be used to create pages like this on the AFSC website: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/2019-southeastern-bering-sea-shelf-bottom-trawl-survey-gets-underway

With this script, we pull temperature content from google drive and then push the maps to google drive for the comms team.
