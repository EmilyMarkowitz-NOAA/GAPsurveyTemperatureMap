Map of the ocean bottom temperatures from the 2023 eastern and northern Bering Sea bottom trawl surveys aboard the F/V Northwest Explorer and F/V Alaska Knight. Updated colors: This year in an effort to make the heatmaps more accessible to a broader audience a new color scheme was used for our heatmaps. However, given feedback we have received we are reverting back to the colors used in previous years. Credit: NOAA Fisheries
