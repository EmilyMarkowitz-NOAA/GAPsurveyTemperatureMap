NOAA Fisheries conducted the Aleutian Islands bottom trawl survey in 2022 aboard the F/V Ocean Explorer and F/V Alaska Provider. This survey covers the Central Aleutians, Eastern Aleutians, Southern Bering Sea, and Western Aleutians regions, which are randomly sampled each year. The near real-time ocean bottom temperatures depicted were collected June 10-August 13. No stations were sampled on August 13. Allocated stations that have not yet been sampled are shown as grey dots. Credit: NOAA Fisheries
