NOAA Fisheries conducted the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey in 2021 aboard the F/V Ocean Explorer and F/V Alaska Provider. This survey covers the Chirikof, Kodiak, Shumagin, Southeastern, and Yakutat regions, which are randomly sampled each year. The near real-time ocean bottom temperatures depicted were collected May 23-August 14. No stations were sampled on August 14. Allocated stations that have not yet been sampled are shown as grey dots.
